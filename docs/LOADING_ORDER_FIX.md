# WordPress Loading Order Fix

## Problem
After updating `is_user_logged_in()` calls with `function_exists('is_user_logged_in') && is_user_logged_in()` guards in `class-slbp-i18n.php`, the frontend worked but the WordPress admin area was broken due to early plugin initialization before WordPress user functions were available.

## Root Cause
The plugin was initializing internationalization features immediately in the plugin constructor, which happens when the plugin file is loaded. This occurs before WordPress has fully loaded user-related functions like `is_user_logged_in()`, `get_current_user_id()`, etc.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Deferred Initialization in Core Plugin (`class-slbp-plugin.php`)
- Moved `set_locale()` and `init_modules()` calls from constructor to WordPress 'init' hook
- Made these methods public so they can be called via hooks
- Added safety checks to prevent double initialization

### 2. Smart Initialization in I18n Class (`class-slbp-i18n.php`)
- Modified constructor to detect if WordPress user functions are available
- If not available, defers initialization to 'init' hook
- If available, initializes immediately
- Added comprehensive `function_exists` guards for all user function calls

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- Added database availability checks before accessing `$wpdb`
- Implemented fallback default languages/currencies when database not available
- Enhanced function guards to check for both function existence and user ID availability

## Benefits
- ✅ **Frontend Works**: Basic functionality available immediately
- ✅ **Admin Area Works**: User-dependent features properly deferred until WordPress ready  
- ✅ **No Fatal Errors**: Comprehensive guards and fallbacks prevent crashes
- ✅ **Full Functionality**: All features work once WordPress fully loaded
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Details
- User detection functions now properly checked: `function_exists('is_user_logged_in') && function_exists('get_current_user_id') && is_user_logged_in()`
- Database operations protected with availability checks
- Initialization order: Dependencies → Admin/Public Hooks → Deferred User-Dependent Features → Modules
- Hooks used: `init` (priority 1 for i18n, priority 2 for modules)

## Files Modified
1. `includes/core/class-slbp-plugin.php` - Plugin initialization order
2. `includes/internationalization/class-slbp-i18n.php` - Smart initialization and error handling
